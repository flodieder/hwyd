# HWYD
You have nobody who asks you how your day was, what you did or how you feel? Fear not: salvation is near.
With HWYD you can create such questions and many more to track your day. To run the app on android simply install the apk or build it yourself using buildozer. To run it on any other platform take a look at the kivy documentation and run main.py.

Visualize your data in the app heavily constrained by what I had time to implement or write your own script using the data.json file where all the data is stored:
